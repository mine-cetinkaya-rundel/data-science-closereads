# data-science-closereads

A repository for scrollytelling-style articles for learning data science with R, built with Quarto and Closeread

## Style

- Functions: Name of function, followed by parantheses, using code formatting, e.g., "`ggplot()`"
- Datasets and variables: Code format, e.g., "`body_mass_g` variable from the `penguins` data frame"
- Packages: First mention is bolded, then no bolding, and no code formatting, e.g., "we use the **ggplot2** package..."
- Line breaks: If a code line spands fewer than 80 characters, can keep in one line. If the line is wider, place each argument on its own line.

For more style guidance, refer to [style.tidyverse.org](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

## Workflow

- Ok to push to main branch but if requesting review put in as a pull requests.
- When making a pull request, first make a new branch.
- Can follow guidance at <https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html#branch-then-make-your-change>.
- When merging a pull request, squash commits.
- For pull requests in progress, mark as draft. When ready, tag reviewer.
